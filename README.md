# Cellular IoT Scripts #

THese scripts are Python drivers for various cellular modems — Quectel BG96, Ublox — fitted with Twilio SIMs: Programmable Wireless and Super SIM.

They were developed during the production of various Twilio SIM tutorials to simplify and bring up to date code offered by suppliers of boards based on the named modems. They are offered not as ‘guaranteed to work’ drivers but as a bases for your own driver development.
